#Image Classification of CIFAR-10 Dataset Images Using Deep Neural Networks

In this project we aim to compare the performance of two deep learning models in the classification of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. Deep Neural Network models with convolution layers and without convolution layers were trained and performance metrics such as accuracy, time to convergence and loss were analyzed. 

The detailed report can also be found in this repository alongside the Jupyter notebook.
